 POLITICS_AUSTEN_CHAMBERLAIN_DESC:0 "Taking up his fathers mantle, of whom he resembles closely, Austen Chamblerain represents a comfortable comprimise between highly imperilistic and moderate democratic elements in parliament. A no-nonsense conservative, Chamberlain and his brother Neville have been active politicians their whole adult life. If there is someone who knows the ins and outs of British politics, its these two."
 POLITICS_STANLEY_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Stanley Baldwin, elected in 1935 following a Conservative majority, has long been a staunch British Imperialist, and a unifying figure for many British citizens. While this government has seen a quick downturn in the economy, and chaos in politics, he remains a symbol of hope for the people and represents what the British Empire can once be again."

 #IRE
 POLITICS_JOACHIM_DESC:0 "Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia, crowned Prince Joachim I of Ireland, was the sixth son of the last king of Prussia, Wilhelm II. When Ireland declared independence during the Great Continental War, the French demanded the recognition of the new state, as well as to hold debate for our new monarch. Prince Joachim was chosen, both for his anti-British sentiment and for his care for our people."

 #FRA
 POLITICS_NAPOLEON_VI_DESC:0 "Napoleon VI of the Second French Empire, has been a beacon for the people of France, that has led their country to its former glory. Crowned in 1926, Napoleon VI is just as, if not more ambitious than his father. Dreaming of reclaiming the French lands conquered by his Great Granduncle, Napoleon I, Napoleon VI will stop at nothing until this is achieved."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_MAURRAS_DESC:0 "Charles Maurras is a well known and respected conservative in France. Although avoiding a direct political career, Maurras has run a series of very successful newspapers over the years demanding a return to the old French way of life. Neither Orleanist nor Bonapartist he only cares for traditional family values, and a glorious France under an absolute monarchy."

 #FIN
 POLITICS_SVINHUFVUD_DESC:0 "The Ukko-Pekka or Grand Old Man Pekka as he is widely known in Finland, is a brutal but welcome president in Finland. Becoming famous for massive purges against Totalists and Socialists within the Finnish government, he has consolidated power and united his country against Left-politics and potential invaders as one of the first real leaders since Finland gained independance."
 POLITICS_MANNERHEIM_DESC:0 "Marshall Mannerheim is a truly brilliant statesman and strategist. Commander of the Finnish White Guard against the Totalist Red Guard during the Red Winter, he has shown himself as one of the best generals of the modern era and have rapidly risen the ranks as a result. Now in politics, Mannerheim does not abandon his militaristic and nationalist nature and intends to lead Finland to glory."
 POLITICS_KYOSTI_KALLIO_DESC:0 "Kyösti Kallio is a long time member of the Argrarian League, and is despised by the right-wing in Finnish politics. Throughout his past Kallio has protested any military action against Russia and refused to denounce the Red Guard during the Red Winter, even being wanted for treason by both the Reds and the Whites. Nevertheless, his unwavering commitment to the Finnish poor has made him a favourite among the Peasanty."

 #SWE
 POLITICS_ALBIN_HANSSON_DESC:0 "Albin Hansson is credited for essentially creating the Socialist Party in Sweden from scratch by himself. He has led the Socialists from an obscure movement to one of the most powerful parties in the Riksdag, and has been its leader for decades. With a focus on nuetrality, peace and welfare he is the most vocal opposition to the far right in Sweden."
 POLITICS_PEHRSSON_BRAMSTORP_DESC:0 "Bramstorp as he is known, has been a parliamentarian for many years, after retiring from farming. He has lead the charge for land reform, and is a respected and well-liked democrat. His Agrarian Party or 'Summer' Party as it is known, has grown largely due to his efforts."
 POLITICS_FELIX_HAMRIN_DESC:0 "Born to poverty, Hamrin has worked as a farmer, leather dealer, shopkeeper, businiessman and investor before entering politics. He has little experience and is suspected of many scandals, but this has not deterred him from taking Swedish politics by storm."




######################### AMERICAS ###################################

 #USA
 POLITICS_ROBERT_LA_FOLETTE_JR_DESC:0 "'Young Bob' as he is popularly known, was a boring and largely unnoteworthy president. While desiring reform, he has been unable to change much of anything due to the poor economic climate, and low Republican support in Congress. The disasterous 1934 midterm elections crippled his ability to pass legislation and his on-the-ticket promise that he wouldnt seek reelection means his presidency is over. With the 1936 elections fast approaching, its anyone's guess who could claim the White House."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "A veteran politician and Southern conservative, Russell Jr. has dominated the conservative coaltion for years, and is determined to do the same in the White House. His cool pragmatism and traditional racist attitudes make him a favourite in rural areas, while his fiery rhetoric makes him a force to contend with in debate. If someone is gonna take the country back to the good old days of America, hes the man to do it."
 POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "Known as 'the Kingfish', Huey Long is a hugely liked figuire throughout the country. His dramatic, nearing ridiculous speeches and notions of saving the country certainly dont fall on deaf ears within the nation. His distance from white supremacy and empathy with the poor make him a favourite across party lines, but his criticism of the elite has certainly made him enemies elsewhere..."
 POLITICS_TEDDY_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "Teddy III is the eldest son of the late Teddy Roosevelt, whose Progressive legacy has certainly lived on with the Republican Party. Having lived the American dream, as a businessman, then as a Brigidier-General, Theodore now intends to take up his fathers mantle, and help his country continue down its path of liberty, life and the pursuit of happyness."
 POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "A devout beliver that America can only be reborn by WASPs, or White Ango-Saxon Protestants, Harry Byrd is a classical Southern racist, white supremacist and 'pay-as-you-go' economic thinker. His party largely known as the 'Byrd Machine' is loyal only to him, and is dead set on solving America's problems both at home and abroad."
 POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Having spent half his life in prison, and the other half on the run, Earl Browder has devoted his life to emancipating the proloteriat from their oppressors and inciting revolution in the US of A. Browder is controversial within the TPUSA as being a loose cannon but respected anyway. Some belive him to be crazy, some a genius, but regardless of what you believe, Browder is gonna get it done or die trying."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "In contrast to Earl Browder, William Z. Foster is a much more complex man, with very little known about his past. A veteran radical, revolutionary and union rep, Foster has led countless strikes and protests to achieve what the TPUSA has achieved today. A great organisor but awkward speaker, he is an isolationist by nature, and by will."
 POLITICS_HOWARD_SCOTT_DESC:0 "One of the worst public speakers in modern times, Howard Scott is a brilliant man with a brilliant mind. Founder and head of the Technocracy Movement from 1922, he has proved himself a capable organisor and administrator. All that is known about his history is that he was an engineer, leading to many a consipracy theory; nevertheless, he certainly has a lot to prove."
 POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "A young upstart in the Byrd Machine, Strom Thurmond is a likeable, compelling young man, that can inspire thousands and lead thousands more. Thurmond is ambitious, and devoted, but struggles to connect with a voter base outside the deep South. A master manipulator, his support comes from wealthy elite, of whom he has many connections."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_PELLEY_DESC:0 "William Pelley has been a key player in the America First Party ever since its founding, and is vital to the maintaining of its various militias ranging from the KKK, to the Silver Legions. Pelley believes that the USA should exert its influence and expand its borders, not shying away from the world in its own isolated pocket."
 POLITICS_LK_SMITH_DESC:0 "L. K. Smith is America's biggest racist and most radical far-right activist. Founder of the America First Party he has shown himself to be vicious and a violent man. Pro-slavery, he is deeply isolationist, but favours strict military rule and a return to traditional protestant values. A vile attitude and even worse temper, he is dangerous to cross."
