 POLITICS_AUSTEN_CHAMBERLAIN_DESC:0 "Taking up his fathers mantle, of whom he resembles closely, Austen Chamblerain represents a comfortable comprimise between highly imperilistic and moderate democratic elements in parliament. A no-nonsense conservative, Chamberlain and his brother Neville have been active politicians their whole adult life. If there is someone who knows the ins and outs of British politics, its these two."
 POLITICS_STANLEY_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Stanley Baldwin, elected in 1935 following a Conservative majority, has long been a staunch British Imperialist, and a unifying figure for many British citizens. While this government has seen a quick downturn in the economy, and chaos in politics, he remains a symbol of hope for the people and represents what the British Empire can once be again."

 POLITICS_JOACHIM_DESC:0 "Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia, crowned Prince Joachim I of Ireland, was the sixth son of the last king of Prussia, Wilhelm II. When Ireland declared independence during the Great Continental War, the French demanded the recognition of the new state, as well as to hold debate for our new monarch. Prince Joachim was chosen, both for his anti-British sentiment and for his care for our people."
