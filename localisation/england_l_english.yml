   POLITICS_AUSTEN_CHAMBERLAIN_DESC:0 "Taking up his fathers mantle, of whom he resembles closely, Austen Chamblerain represents a comfortable comprimise between highly imperilistic and moderate democratic elements in parliament. A no-nonsense conservative, Chamberlain and his brother Neville have been active politicians their whole adult life. If there is someone who knows the ins and outs of British politics, its these two."
   POLITICS_STANLEY_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Stanley Baldwin, elected in 1935 following a Conservative majority, has long been a staunch British Imperialist, and a unifying figure for many British citizens. While this government has seen a quick downturn in the economy, and chaos in politics, he remains a symbol of hope for the people and represents what the British Empire can once be again."

   ENG_political_chaos:0 "Political Chaos"
   ENG_political_chaos_desc:0 "Ever since Britain won the war against the original Corsican Emperor the talking shop of Westminster has been in content in international affairs, even when the new Emperor Napoleon III crushed the Prussians at Sedan, business carried on as normal. However ever since the end of the Fashoda War seen by many in Britain as a fault of the British Parliament who did not have the will to fight, the country has been gripped in Chaos. \n\nNow many extremists and fringe groups try to claim the support of the British public, whilst any cooperation in Parliament between Labour, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats has practically broken down. The stability of the Island nation and the Empire has been rocked and lack of investment in welfare has caused a weariness amongst the British people."
   ENG_rule_britannia:0 "Rule Britannia"
   ENG_rule_britannia_desc:0 "Fighting waves of Romans, Vikings, Normans, as well as nearly every Great Power, Britain has turned into a highly formidable nation in the Art of War, with the Royal Navy ruling the seas, a strong sense of Jingoism and Imperialism has gripped the Isles ever since the 16th Century. Heroes such as Drake, Nelson and recently Jackie Fisher are highly celebrated in Britain. Now with the country facing more perilous times against their centurys old arch enemy France, a strong sense of national unity and service has swept the country to once again in the hopes of creating a Pax Brittanica."
   ENG_stagnant_economy:0 "Stagnant Economy"
   ENG_stagnant_economy_desc:0 "With the Empire cutting through another generation of the Empire’s finest and only ending up with a bitter stalemate, the British economy has down spiralled into a perilous state, with the trade unions demanding more and more concessions. With the loss of the Suez Canal to the French, among many other valuable colonies, factories across Britain have been underperforming ever since. Britain's brightest minds have recently been more focussed on surviving rather than thriving, and the situation will not improve by itself. Something must be done."
